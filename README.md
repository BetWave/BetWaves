# BetWaves

BetWaves is a tool to navigate Betfair Exchange markets using live data, and therefore minimise the advantage Betmakers have over general users. This is achieved primarily by providing a platform to define and execute betting strategies automatically, and secondly by presenting live data regarding market trends with which the user can make an informed decision whether to enter/leave the market.

## Installation

Basic usage:

The branch should be cloned/downloaded locally and the .exe file started.

Development usage:

The tool should be cloned to a local directory, and executed in a Python environment.
